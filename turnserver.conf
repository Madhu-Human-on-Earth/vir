# Minimal coturn config for Railway (TCP/TLS focused)
# Replace realm and cert paths if you use TLS/certbot later

# Listening ports
listening-port=3478
tls-listening-port=5349

# Listen on all interfaces
listening-ip=0.0.0.0
relay-ip=0.0.0.0

# UDP relay range (may not be available on Railway)
min-port=49152
max-port=65535

# Use long-term credentials
lt-cred-mech

# Realm (your domain or the Railway project name)
realm=${TURN_REALM}

# Static user via env (populated in runtime by envsubst below)
# We'll allow coturn to read user via 'user' line substitution
# The Dockerfile copied the config, so instruct Railway to set env and replace below.
user=${TURN_USER}:${TURN_PASS}

# Recommended options
fingerprint
no-stdout-log
# secure-stun: no, not required
# cert/pkey entries not set — TLS (turns) will work if Railway provides TLS or if you add certs.
